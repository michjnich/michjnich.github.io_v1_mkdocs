Roles \u00b6 At some point I have worked with most IT roles, including, but not limited to: Developer / Lead Dev Tester Business Analyst - Requirements & Processes Solution & System Architect Team Lead Manager Domains \u00b6 Since 1997 I have worked primarily in the Telco domain (B/OSS).

A few of these I put up at 500px Painting \u00b6 Having been told in school that I should drop art as I had no talent in that area, I learned to sketch and paint while living in Melbourne, Australia. I'm still not very good, but I enjoy it, and I now know I'm not as bad as my art teacher would have had me believe. At some point, I may include some photos of some of my paintings. Other Sidelines \u00b6 Translation \u00b6 I provide translation services from Swedish to (UK) English, or proofreading services to validate against the original Swedish if you already have a translation. Contact me for rates. Voice artist \u00b6 If you need an audio recording in reasonably neutral British accent (though not the Queen's English!), get in touch. To date, I have mostly provided recordings for online courses for education companies.","title":"About Me"},{"location":"#michael-j-nicholson","text":"LinkedIn Curriculum Vitae","title":"Michael J.
