Nicholson LinkedIn Curriculum Vitae Technical I cut my teeth programming at the age of 10 with Sinclair BASIC on the ZX81 - 1kB of RAM in a tiny plastic box, where programs needed to be saved and loaded via a bitstream to cassette tape. Roles At some point I have worked with most IT roles, including, but not limited to: Developer / Lead Dev Tester Business Analyst - Requirements & Processes Solution & System Architect Team Lead Manager Domains Since 1997 I have worked primarily in the Telco domain (B/OSS). Outside of that I also have experience with Finance and Pensions. Almost all this work has been on Enterprise level systems. Technologies Desired focus Python Django (or other framework) Linux Docker Cloud DevOps Areas I would like to get some experience in AI / Machine Learning Things I've played with recently that seem interesting Elm Functional Programming What I've worked on in the past Oracle (DB, SQL, PL/SQL) ISAM-based databases Various flavours of *nix Scripting ProIV (largely redundant 4GL, still used on a few legacy sites) Creative Writing I have written numerous short stories, mostly speculative fiction with a leaning towards horror. Some of these have been published, with a couple more in the pipeline. Portfolio Author pages: Amazon US UK Goodreads Online publications: Twist - Electric Spec, Vol. 13, Issue 3 Side Effects - NoSleep Podcast, Season 12, Episode 24 Photography I enjoy taking photographs, though am strictly an amateur in this domain. A few of these I put up at 500px Painting Having been told in school that I should drop art as I had no talent in that area, I learned to sketch and paint while living in Melbourne, Australia. I'm still not very good, but I enjoy it, and I now know I'm not as bad as my art teacher would have had me believe. At some point, I may include some photos of some of my paintings.","title":"About Me"},{"location":"#michael-j-nicholson","text":"LinkedIn Curriculum Vitae","title":"Michael J.
