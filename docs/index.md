## Technical
I cut my teeth programming at the age of 10 with Sinclair BASIC on the ZX81 - 1kB of RAM in a tiny plastic box, where programs needed to be saved and loaded via a bitstream to cassette tape.

#### Photography
I enjoy taking photographs, though am strictly an amateur in this domain. A few of these I put up at [500px](https://www.500px.com/michjnich)
#### Painting
Having been told in school that I should drop art as I had no talent in that area, I learned to sketch and paint while living in Melbourne, Australia. I'm still not very good, but I enjoy it, and I now know I'm not as bad as my art teacher would have had me believe.

At some point, I may include some photos of some of my paintings.
