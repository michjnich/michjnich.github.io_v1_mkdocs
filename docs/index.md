|The blog hosting on Ghost.org was a good service, but just a little expensive for me, especially after the events of 2021/2022. I am working on self-hosting my blog and am currently looking into the options. Stay tuned!|

## Technical
I cut my teeth programming at the age of 10 with Sinclair BASIC on the ZX81 - 1kB of RAM in a tiny plastic box, where programs needed to be saved and loaded via a bitstream to cassette tape. 
#### Roles
At some point I have worked with most IT roles, including, but not limited to:

* Developer / Lead Dev
* Tester
* Business Analyst - Requirements & Processes
* Solution & System Architect
* Team Lead
* Manager
#### Domains
Since 1997 I have worked primarily in the Telco domain (B/OSS). Outside of that I also have experience with Finance and Pensions. Almost all this work has been on Enterprise level systems. 
#### Technologies

##### Desired focus
* Python
* Django (or other framework)
* Linux
* Docker
* Cloud
* DevOps
* Domain Driven Design
##### Areas I would like to get some experience in
* AI / Machine Learning
##### Things I've played with recently that seem interesting
* Vue3
* Elm
* Functional Programming
* Flutter
* Dart
##### Languages/frameworks I'd like to look into when I have the time
* Go
* Rust
* Haskell (just discovered [IHP](https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com), so may try to learn it this way)
* WebAssembly
* Svelte
##### What I've worked on in the past
* Oracle (DB, SQL, PL/SQL)
* ISAM-based databases
* Various flavours of *nix
* Scripting
* ProIV (largely redundant 4GL, still used on a few legacy sites)

## Creative
#### Writing
I have written numerous short stories, mostly speculative fiction with a leaning towards horror. Some of these have been published, with a couple more in the pipeline.

#### Photography
I enjoy taking photographs, though am strictly an amateur in this domain. A few of these I put up at [500px](https://www.500px.com/michjnich)
#### Painting
Having been told in school that I should drop art as I had no talent in that area, I learned to sketch and paint while living in Melbourne, Australia. I'm still not very good, but I enjoy it, and I now know I'm not as bad as my art teacher would have had me believe.

At some point, I may include some photos of some of my paintings.

## Other Sidelines
#### Translation
I provide translation services from Swedish to (UK) English, or proofreading services to validate against the original Swedish if you already have a translation. 

Contact me for rates.
#### Voice artist
If you need an audio recording in reasonably neutral British accent (though not the Queen's English!), get in touch. To date, I have mostly provided recordings for online courses for education companies.
